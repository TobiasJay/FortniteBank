# FortniteBanking

This app is a project created to practice secure web app development principles. As developers we want to create code that does not fall victim to XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection and User enumeration attacks. 

Users (Alice and Bob) can login, view their accounts and transfer money between accounts without being pwned!
It is Fortnite Themed :)
