# FortniteBanking

This app is a project created to practice secure web app development principles. As developers we want to create code that does not fall victim to XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection and User enumeration attacks.
This assignment helped my hammer down those principles and concepts in a close to real life application.
It's made me realize how simple it is to stop these vulnerabilities from happening. However, as humans 
we are forgetful and make mistakes. It is important to be ever vigilant!

Users (Alice and Bob) can login, view their accounts and transfer money between accounts without being pwned!
It is Fortnite Themed :)
